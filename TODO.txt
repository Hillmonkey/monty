TODO

* build all the op_code functions
	2 more mandatory op_codes

====================================
3 spots for global variable:
	build struct in header
	declare global glob_t glob in header
	declare again (only once) at top of main file
	you can have an global init func
Why is global needed?
	tracking line number, maybe?
	tracking pointers that need to be freed	

* free all the nodes of the stack in exit function
	the nodes get created in the push function
	maybe that's where they can be tracked from, for
	eventual freeing ...
* since atexit requires a func of the form:
	void func(void) ...
	you need a global variable to free things from atexit func
		(if you use the global variable)
