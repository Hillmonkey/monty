TODO

* extract tokens from each line
	* use token[0] for all op_codes
	* token[1] needs to get put into external push_operand variable

* build all the op_code functions
* build the function that calls the op_code functions
* build struct that links the op_codes to the op_code functions

====================================
3 spots for global variable:
	build struct in header
	declare global glob_t glob in header
	declare again (only once) at top of main file
	you can have an global init func

* free all the nodes of the stack in exit function
	the nodes get created in the push function
	maybe that's where they can be tracked from, for
	eventual freeing ...
* per Tanya - substitute strtol for atoi
* since atexit requires a func of the form:
	void func(void) ...
	you need a global variable to free things from atexit func
		(if you use the global variable)
